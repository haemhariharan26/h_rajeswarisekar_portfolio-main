2. The design philosophy revolves around a colour scheme of Purple, white and Grey, strategically chosen to emphasise the content and the work showcased, promoting a minimalist and elegant aesthetic.


3. Homepage: This initial landing page serves as an introduction to the portfolio. It features an 'About Me' section where I'll provide insights into my background and expertise. It also includes my recent projects (hyperlink connected), team projects and testimonials section. The focus here is on presenting my skill set and my contributions to the world of web design, graphic design, and motion design.


4. To enhance the user experience, GreenSock animations will be incorporated. These animations will include scroll effects and hover animations, adding an engaging and dynamic dimension to the portfolio website, making it visually appealing.


5. Portfolio Pages: These pages are powered by a versatile JavaScript framework. One distinctive feature of these pages is the dynamic display of project descriptions. When you hover your cursor over an image, a new tab pops up, revealing comprehensive details about the work showcased.


6. The 'About Us,' 'Home,' and 'Projects' sections are constructed using a stack of PHP, SASS, HTML, and JavaScript. These pages are enriched with various animation effects, further enhancing the overall user experience and interactivity of the website.


7. This portfolio website aims to present my skills and work in an engaging, professional, and aesthetically pleasing manner. It's a culmination of both design and functionality, combining cutting-edge technology and elegant aesthetics to create a memorable and informative online presence.
